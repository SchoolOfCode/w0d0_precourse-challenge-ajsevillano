        <p class="tribute-info-text">
          Carl Edward Sagan (November 9, 1934 â€“ December 20, 1996) was an
          American astronomer, planetary scientist, cosmologist, astrophysicist,
          astrobiologist, author, and science communicator. His best known
          scientific contribution is research on extraterrestrial life,
          including experimental demonstration of the production of amino acids
          from basic chemicals by radiation. Sagan assembled the first physical
          messages sent into space, the Pioneer plaque and the Voyager Golden
          Record, universal messages that could potentially be understood by any
          extraterrestrial intelligence that might find them. Sagan argued the
          hypothesis, accepted since, that the high surface temperatures of
          Venus can be attributed to and calculated using the greenhouse
          effect.[2] Initially an associate professor at Harvard, Sagan later
          moved to Cornell where he would spend the majority of his career as
          the David Duncan Professor of Astronomy and Space Sciences. Sagan
          published more than 600 scientific papers and articles and was author,
          co-author or editor of more than 20 books.[3] He wrote many popular
          science books, such as The Dragons of Eden, Cosmos, Broca's Brain,
          Pale Blue Dot and narrated and co-wrote the award-winning 1980
          television series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage. The most widely watched
          series in the history of American public television, Cosmos, has been
          seen by at least 500 million people in 60 countries.[4] The book
          Cosmos was published to accompany the series. He also wrote the 1985
          science fiction novel Contact, the basis for a 1997 film of the same
          name. His papers, containing 595,000 items,[5] are archived at The
          Library of Congress.[6] Sagan advocated scientific skeptical inquiry
          and the scientific method, pioneered exobiology and promoted the
          Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI). He spent most of his
          career as a professor of astronomy at Cornell University, where he
          directed the Laboratory for Planetary Studies. Sagan and his works
          received numerous awards and honors, including the NASA Distinguished
          Public Service Medal, the National Academy of Sciences Public Welfare
          Medal, the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction for his book The
          Dragons of Eden, and, regarding Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, two Emmy
          Awards, the Peabody Award, and the Hugo Award. He married three times
          and had five children. After suffering from myelodysplasia, Sagan died
          of pneumonia at the age of 62, on December 20, 1996.
